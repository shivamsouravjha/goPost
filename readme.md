# Keploy Traffic to Postman Collection Converter

## Overview
This Go-based project processes traffic data recorded from end-to-end test cases generated by [Keploy](https://github.com/keploy/keploy), extracting cURL commands from the traffic logs and converting them into a structured Postman collection. This tool allows developers and testers to quickly integrate tested endpoints into Postman for further API testing and interaction.

## Features
- **Traffic Parsing**: Parse Keploy-generated traffic logs to extract cURL commands.
- **Postman Collection Generation**: Convert the extracted cURL commands into a Postman collection format.
- **Automation Support**: Automate the process to run after test completion to update Postman collections continuously.
- **Filtering Options**: Include options to filter which requests are included based on various criteria (HTTP method, status code, endpoint, etc.).
